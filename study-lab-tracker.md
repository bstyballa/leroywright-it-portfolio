### 🧠 Tip:
Each time you finish a week or lab, write a short reflection in your README or journal file:
> “✅ Week 1 Complete – Learned how switches populate MAC tables and used Wireshark to observe ICMP packets. Uploaded screenshots to GitHub.”

Those weekly notes will make your growth visible — and that’s what impresses employers most.
